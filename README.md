# Fluffy elephant task 

# Scrive elm challenge

Hello! Welcome to the Scrive Elm Challenge.

This repository contains the requirements definition of a project used for job applications
for a **position of an [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) developer at Scrive**.
The whole task is based on a real part of our production application and real needs we have addressed.

It also contains the skeleton of an Elm application with technologies we are currently 
using - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Task parts

You must deliver at least one part of your choice. (You can of course do more parts).

You can choose from following parts:

- [Settings](task-settings.md)
- [Contact details](task-contact-details.md)
- [Tags](task-tags.md)


## Goal

The aim is to test your ability to come up with a solution to a real-world problem that will be part of your day-to-day responsibilities.
Obviously the first thing what we will look at is the extent to which your implementation meets the original requirements.
We also want to see your ability to come up with a robust solution and will look at the overall code quality.

## Where to Start

If you are interested in applying for an Elm developer position or just want to challenge yourself (which is also 100% OK with us),
please follow the steps below:

- Pick at least one [task](#task-parts) and read through the requirements.
- Fork this repository under your GitHub account.
- Complete an implementation within your fork.
- Open a pull request to the [original](https://github.com/scrive/elm-challenge/) repository with your own implementation.
- Make your pull request ready for review to let us know that we can review your code.
- Comment your PR with any questions in case you need any help

**You can also open a draft pull request before you finish the implementation in case you want to discuss anything with us!**

Good luck and enjoy the challenge.
