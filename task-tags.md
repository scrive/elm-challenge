# Task - Tags

## Instructions

Your task is to implement a form for Tags part of User group data.

Feel free to use any package or technique you are used to or you would like to try out.

You have a data provided to you as a `JSON` string in `Data.elm` module. They are based on what our [API](https://apidocs.scrive.com/#view-user-group) returns.

## Requirements

The form should only display fields for values in tags.

You should be able to add and remove tags and edit their values.

Value of tag is optional - it might not be presented in the data.

Tags should have unique names. You should not allow duplicate names of tags.

Names should not be longer than 32 characters

## Nice to have

- is responsive
- is accessible
